<p class="style1">1. Import the EasyRoads3D package in your project. <a href="#install" class="link">More Info...</a></p>
                  <p class="style1">2. You will see a new menu item &quot;EasyRoads3D&quot;  in the top horizontal menu under GameObject &gt; Create Other &gt;  EasyRoads3D. Select &quot;New EasyRoads3D Object&quot; from the EasyRoads3D menu. In the <a href="#newobject" class="link">window</a> that will appear you can select the object type and you can set the name for the new object. Select &quot;Road Object&quot; as the object type<strong> </strong>and optionally change the name that is displayed by default. <a href="#newobject" class="link">More Info...</a></p>
                  <p class="style1"> A new EasyRoads3D road object with the <A class="link" href="#newobject"></A>name you entered is created in the scene hierarchy. It will  be selected automatically and in the Inspector you will see the EasyRoads3D Toolbar.<img src="images/menugui.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="122" style="vertical-align:top"> <a href="#gettingstarted" class="link">More Info...</a></p>
                  <p class="style1">3. Select the most left &quot;Add Markers&quot; tab, hold the [Shift] key and click in scene view on the terrain where you want to start the road. Continue adding markers by holding the [shift] key and clicking in scene view on the terrain defining the shape of the road. These are the control points that will define the shape of the road. After placing 3 markers they will start to connect. The white surfaces represent the shape to which the terrain will be adjusted. The road mesh itself will also become visible. Please <a href="#trouble" class="link">click here</a> if at this stage you cannot see the road and white surface mesh. <a href="#addmarkers" class="link">More Info...</a></p>
                  <p class="style1">4. Click the middle mountain (Level terrain) tab in the above toolbar to start deforming the terrain heightmap according the road shape. This may take a while depending on the road shape, length and the terrains heightmap resolution. When finished, the white surfaces will disappear and the terrain will match the road mesh.</p>

However when side objects have been built in render mode you will see that the marker objects appear again. By selecting a marker you can adjust the side object settings for this marker for any of the available side objects. Depending on the type of side object you will see the following properties:</p>
                  <p class="style1"><strong>Selected Object:</strong> this is a combobox with all available side objects. Select the side object from the list you want to edit.</p>
                  <p class="style1"><strong>Display Object:</strong> Toggle this on/off when you want to render the selected side object for the selected marker.</p>

The road scene in the demo project uses this feature for the &quot;Right Fence&quot; in the sharp corner. It cuts of a large part of the road shape. This allows you to create shapes that run independently from the actual road shape.</p>

You can add your own textures in this folder if you like to use this system. Below each texture you will see the supported shaders for this texture. Currently supported shaders are: Diffuse, Bumped Diffuse and Bumped Specular. The name convention is: texturename_d for the diffuse texture and texturename_b for the bumped texture. When the window opens, the above mentioned folder will be scanned and matching materials will be added to the dropdown box accordingly. Select the shader type and then click the road texture to assign it to the road material.</p>
                  <p class="style1">The folder /Assets/EasyRoads3D/Shaders/ contains 6 different depth offset shaders to make sure the road is rendered on top of the terrain. When using a low Field of View on the camera you may still encounter some z-fighting. In this case open the respective shader and tweak the two Offset factor and unit parameters (just below LOD) further downwards.</p>
                  <p class="style1"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Currently all road objects in a project use the same material. Changing the material on one of them will change the material on all other road objects. In the next release this will be handled per road object individually.

You can choose between the standard &quot;Diffuse&quot; and &quot;Transparent&quot; shader. The advantage of the standard &quot;Diffuse&quot; shader is that the road and surface geometry is clearly visible on top of the terrain in hilly areas. The advantage of the &quot;Transparent&quot; shader is that you can control the opacity of the road surfaces with the &quot;Surface Opacity&quot; slider that will appear when this option is selected. This will make it easy to accurately draw road shapes when using a road map overlay texture as the terrain texture. The roads on the map will be clearly visible through the road surfaces.</li>
                    <li class="style1"><strong>Surface Opacity.</strong> This controls the transparency of the road surfaces and is especially useful when you use map overlays. Simply lower the opacity level so roads ont the map are clearly visible. This will make it easier to position the road markers.</li>
                    <li class="style1"><strong>Multiple Terrain.</strong> Toggle this On if you have multiple terrains in your scene.</li>
                    <li class="style1"><strong>Restore.</strong> This option will be enabled when the previous setting, Multiple Terrains, is toggled on. &quot;Restore&quot; refers to the process of restoring the terrain data to its original state before building the road and deforming the terrain. Keep this toggled on until you are finished with the road. Then toggle it Off. The terrain will not be restored to its original state. This setting will allow you to build all terrains one by one once you are finished with the road(s). </li>
                    <li class="style1"><strong>Backup Location.</strong> By default EasyRoads3D stores backup data of the terrains in the folder [your project]/EasyRoads3D. In the same folder you will find road object specific data such as exported road geometry and road splatmap files. The EasyRoads3D folder is located outside the assets folder to avoid unnecessary file imports by the Unity importer. However, if you use the Unity asset server you will most likely need these files to rebuild the terrain after projects have been saved with EasyRoads3D objects in &quot;Build&quot; mode. You probably also like to synchronize manual terrain backups after manual changes to the terrain. In this case, chose &quot;Inside Assets Folder&quot; from the drop down list. Also make sure to hit ctrl-R before you commit changes to the Asset server!</li>
                    <li class="style1"><span class="style8">Enable Debugging. </span>Check this when you are experiencing issues when using EasyRoads3D. It will write debug info to the console which will help us to solve problems. </li>

                    <li class="style1"><strong>Road indent.</strong> The part outside the road that will have the same height level as the road. The value of this parameter will always be bigger then the distance between 2 terrain points to avoid the terrain popping through the road geometry, <a href="#indents" class="link">more info</a>.</li>
                    <li class="style1"><strong>Raise markers (cm).</strong> When adding a road marker the y position of the marker will match the y position of the terrain at the specific point. This property will automatically raise or lower the marker position according the entered value. This is a simple but effective feature to add focus and detail to the road and near surrounding. Set it before adding markers! </li>
                    <li class="style1"><strong>Force Y position.<a name="forceY"></a></strong>This is a useful feature when creating shapes with consistent y position changes, like rivers. When checked you will be able to assign a value. This value represents the y change per meter. When you add markers, the new marker will inherit the y position of the previous marker + this value * the distance between the markers.</li>
                    <li class="style1"> <strong>Surrounding.</strong> Distance between the road and the terrain used for smooth transitions</li>
                    <li class="style1"><strong>Closed Track</strong>. This will stitch  the start and end of the road together  and is useful for creating race tracks.</li>
                    <li class="style1"><strong>iOS Platform.</strong> This will optimize the road mesh UVs for the iOS platform and prevent common texture distortion issues on this platform caused by repetetive UVs.</li>
                    <li class="style1"><strong>Geometry Resolution.</strong> This controls the geometry resolution of the road surfaces. 1 represents the highest resolution towards 5 representing the lowest resolution level. It is recommended to use the lowest level (5)  while creating the road as it will improve performance although it may lead to<a href="#indents" class="link"> less accurate</a> results. Just make sure to set it at level 1 when testing the terrain leveling. Level 1 will always automatically be used when building the terrain and road geometry.<strong><a name="activeTerrain" id="activeTerrain"></a></strong></li>
                    <li class="style1"><strong>Tangents.</strong> This will automatically calculate mesh tangent data after clicking the middle tab which also generates the final road mesh. Mesh tangent data is required if you use a bumped shader on your road.</li>
                    <li class="style1"><strong>Active Terrain.</strong> This setting allows you to set the currently active terrain in the case you have more then one terrain object in your scene. When processing the terrain and road (middle tab) the selected terrain will be affected. Alternatibely you can use Ctrl+Alt+Click this will automatcially set the clicked terrain as the selected terrain in the  dropdown.</li>
                    <li class="style1"><strong>Update Vegetation.</strong> When toggled on all tree and detail objects near the road will be removed. For both tree objects and detail objects individually you can specify the distance to the road within these objects will be removed <strong><span class="style2">(Full version &amp; Pro only)</span></strong>. Depending on the number of tree and especially detail objects in the scene this process can take up some time. You may choose too disable this feature during testing the road and terrain leveling to speed up rendering the terrain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Active Side Objects <span class="style2"> (Full version &amp; Pro only)</span>.</strong> Here all available side objects will be listed. You can toggle on / off side objects for this particular EasyRoads3D object. This will make it much easier to control your scene and manage side object settings per marker</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Multiple terrains. Currently terrains are processed individually by selecting the active terrain (point 14 above). This minimizes processing time when working on a specific part of the road. In the next release a progressbar will be visible and the option to proces all terrains at once. The reason why this is not implemented right now is because procssing a large number of terrains at once can take some time. It will be confusing to know what is going on without a progressbar visible.</p>

Save or export to .fbx. In Unity make sure that the import setting for size is 1. Choose a lightmap supported shader on your road asset and drag the terrain lightmap to the shaders lightmap slot. Drag the asset to your scene go to the EasyRoads3D menu and select &quot;Position Road&quot;, browse to the EasyRoads3D terrain export file and select it. The road will be positioned correctly. </p>

                  <p><strong>SIDE OBJECTS <span class="style2"> (Full version &amp; Pro only)</span>:</strong><a name="sideobjects"></a></p>
                  <p>The Side Objects feature is a powerful tool which will significantly lower your production time. In general you can create 3 types of side objects:</p>
                  <p>1. By instantiating game objects / prefabs.<br>
                  2. By defining the shape of procedural geometry<br>
                  3. A combination of these two.</p>
                  <p>Side Objects are managed through the Side Object Manager.</p>
                  <p><strong>Side Object Manager:</strong><a name="sideobjectmanager"></a></p>
                  <p>Menu &gt; EasyRoads3D &gt; Side Objects &gt; Object Manager</p>
                  <p><strong>Instantiated Side Objects:</strong></p>
                  <p><img src="images/object_manager.jpg" width="556" height="424"></p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Selected Object:</strong> Use this combobox to selected and edit created side objects</li>
                    <li><strong>Create New Object:</strong> Click this button to create a new side object.</li>
                    <li><strong>Duplicate Object:</strong> Click this button to duplicate the selected side object. This is a useful feature to quickly create identical objects used on both the left and right side of the road</li>
                    <li><strong>Import Objects:</strong> This will display the &quot;open file&quot; dialog, browse to the &quot;sideobjectsLog.er3dObjects&quot; typically located in /Assets/EasyRoads3D of a Unity project. All side objects in this file will be displayed in a new window, you can select side objects and click import. This will import all selected side objects into the current project. The easiest way to use this is by renaming the &quot;sideobjectsLog.er3dObjects&quot; file in the original project. Export this file including all associated side object assets like start/end objects, material etc. to a Unity package. Import this Unity package in your current project and import the renamed .er3dObjects side objects file through the Side Object Manager.</li>
                    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> The name of the side object</li>
                    <li><strong>Object Type: </strong>Select the appropriate side object type from the combo. In the case of instantiated side objects choose&quot;imported Mesh Object&quot;.</li>
                    <li><strong>Object:</strong> Drag the gameobject / prefab you want to use for this side object in the corresponding slot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Terrain Vegetation: </strong>The combobox will show all tree prototypes currently added to the terrain object. Selecting one of the prototypes will move the associated prefab to the object slot. Once you are finished with tweaking the side object settings you can add all instantiated trees to the terrain vegetation data with all the the advantages of for example tree billboarding, etc. Do this by selecting the specific side object in the hierarchy and click the &quot;Update Terrain vegetation&quot; button in the Inspector.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vegetation Scale:</strong> Use this min/max slider to set the minimum maximum scale boundaries for vegetation side objects. A random scale between the two will be chosen for each tree instance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prefab Childs:</strong> This feature is enabled when more then 1 child object exists in the prefab. So the correct way to use this feature is to setup your prefab in a way that all possible objects are childs of the parent prefab. You have 3 options: <br>
                      - 
                    All: this will instantiate all child objects per new instance<br>
                    - Child sequence: this will go through all child objects according the child index and instantiate a single child object per instance<br>
                    - Random: 
this will randomly select a child object per instance. If you want specific objects to be instantiated more often, simply duplicate them in the prefab so there is more chance that they will be chosen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Distance:</strong> The distance between instantiated objects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Y-axis Rotation:</strong> This controls the rotation on the y-axis. Options are &quot;Follow Road&quot;, &quot;Fixed&quot; and &quot;Random&quot;.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sideways Position:</strong> This defines the default position to the right or left of the center of the road. <a href="#sideObjectMarker" class="link">This position can be adjusted for each marker</a> , therefore changes to this value in the Object manager will currently not affect this side object on existing road objects as it will overwrite possible manually adjusted values per marker. </li>
                    <li><strong>Density:</strong> a value between 0 and 1 which indicates the chance of how often the object should be instantiated relative to the distance setting. A value of 1 means always.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maximum Offset:</strong> you can use this setting to position the objects perpendicular to the direction of the path over a random distance with a maximum of the chosen value. 0 means exactly on the path. This feature is useful for objects such as rock formations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Align with Terrain:</strong> When checked the object will be aligned according the normal of the terrain at the objects position.</li>
                    <li><strong>Combine Instantiated:</strong> Depending on the used materials, this will combine all instantiated objects into a single object.<br>
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>For procedural objects choose &quot;Procedural Mesh Object&quot; as the Object Type. You will see that the properties will change:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Edit Geometry:</strong> Click this button to define the shape of the procedural object.</li>
                    <li><strong>Start Asset / End Asset: </strong>When you disable this type object for specific markers a gap will appear at the start and end of the procedurally created geometry. This gap can be avoided by using start and end objects modeled in your modeling application. Import the objects in Unity and drag these objects to the appropriate slots. The shape of these objects can be used to define the shape of the procedurally created geometry. See important extra<a href="#sideObjectsImportant" class="link"> info below</a>.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Controller: </strong>This controls the geometry structure and positioning, the options are &quot;Clamp Left&quot;, &quot;Clamp Right&quot; and &quot;Spline Controller&quot;. &quot;Clamp Left&quot; and &quot;Clamp Right&quot; will create geometry based on the resolution and vertice positions of the road geometry. &quot;Clamp Left&quot; will create the geometry at the left side of the road,  &quot;Clamp Right&quot; will create the geometry at the right side of the road. When &quot;Spline Controller&quot; is selected the geometry will be created according a new spline. New properties will appear (see the image below).<br>
                        <br>

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Distance Sideways: </strong>The default distance  to the right or left of the center of the road. Note that this refers to the spline position of the marker. <a href="#sideObjectMarker" class="link">This position can be adjusted for each marker</a>. When this setting is not 0 for all or some markers this side object will be positioned on its own spline shape based on the sideways distances. If you want to align side objects exactly according the road shape, use X Positioning in the <a href="#sideobjectinpector" class="link">Inspector of the specific side object</a>. When you change the default sideways distance setting you have several options to choose from: 1. Do not update exisiting EasyRoads3D objects (the changed setting will only b applied to new EasyRoads3D objects). 2. Update all markers in all EasyRoads3D objects (be careful with this option, all manually adjusted marker settings will be lost!). 3. Only update markers with the previous default Sideways Distance value applied (this option will preserve the values of manually adjusted markers)</li>
                    <li><strong>Face Distance: </strong>The distance in forward direction between vertices. Use this to control resolution of the geometry.</li>
                    <li><strong>Align with Terrain: </strong>Options are: 1. None, which means no rotation, 2. Terrain Normal, this will align the side object according the terrain normal at that point, 3. Follow Path, this will align the side object according the forward direction of the path, 4. Path Sideways. This will align objects exactly accordin the shape of the road.</li>
                    <li><strong>Connection Object: </strong>Optionally you can assign a gameobject / prefab as a connection object. This object will be instantiated along the procedural shape. An example is the train lead and post geometry in the demo project.</li>
                    <li><strong>Material: </strong>Drag the material you want to use for the procedurally created mesh to this slot. Note that the uvs of procedural objects move in Y direction. With regard to textures for objects like walls or fences you may have to rotate it 90 degrees. In a future version you will be able to control whether the uvs move in Y or X direction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Combine procedural geometry..:</strong> This option appears for procedural side objects that have &quot;start&quot; and / or &quot;end&quot; assets applied. When toggled on the final geometry will be combined in a single mesh. Note that all objects must have the same material applied!</li>
                    <li><strong>Weld matching vertices..:</strong> This option appears when &quot;Combine procedural geometry...&quot; is turned on. It will weld vertices at the same position, those at the attach points between the procedural geometry and &quot;start&quot; / &quot;end&quot; assets. The advantage is, the normals will look better, the disadvantage is that, depending on the original values on the &quot;start&quot; and &quot;end&quot; assets, the UVs may look wrong. In this case you may get better results when editing the geometry in a modeling application.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>As explained above you can use start and end gameobjects / prefabs to close gaps on procedurally created geometry. It is important that these objects are correctly rotated. Depending on the modeling application you use, gameobjects may be rotated and point in the wrong direction after being imported. Always make sure that they point in the correct direction. You can check this by selecting the object with the mesh renderer attached in the project view and have a close look at the preview pane. </p>
                  <p>Look at the images below. On the left you see the imported geometry of the &quot;left end of the wall&quot; object in the road demo. The intention is to snap this object to the end of the wall with the open gap. However the closed area is pointing towards us, this is the wrong direction. The importer rotated the object by 180 degrees on the y-axis. The solution here is to create a prefab and use the gameobject with the mesh renderer attached as a child of the prefab. It is very important that the mesh renderer is a component of the child of the prefab and not the parent object. Make sure that the relative position of this child object is Vector3(0,0,0) and, in this case, rotate the child object 180 degrees on the y-axis in the Inspector. You can see the result on the right. Now the gameobject is pointing in the correct direction. Have a look at the demo project. Depending on your modeling application and export settings within the modeling application you may have to rotate the child on the x-axis or z-axis too. If this is the case, just experiment with rotation values until the object looks correct in the preview pane. </p>

This window will open when you click the button <a href="#editGeo" class="link">&quot;Edit Geometry&quot;</a> on the right of the Object Type combo box.

                    <li><strong>Selected Index:</strong> When you select a point the associated index value will be displayed in the ComboBox. The purpose of this is become explained in the NOTE here below.</li>
                    <li><strong>Close Geometry:</strong> When checked, the first and last point will connect.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trace Object: </strong>if you added a Start or / and End object to the associated slots in the <a href="#editGeo" class="link">Object Manager</a> this object will appear here. It can be used to analyze the geometry and automatically define the shape of the procedural geometry accordingly. Make sure that those vertices used to connect the start and end assets with the procedural with each other are at position 0 on, depending on your modeling application, the y-axis or z-axis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trace On:</strong> Depending on the rotation of the asset you may have to switch between x-axis, y-axis and z-axis until you clearly see the shape that the procedural geometry should have. By default objects are traced on the z-axis when opening the editor window and no points are stored yet for this side object.</li>
                    <li><strong>Auto Connect:</strong> Below the situation is described where you can clearly see that the dots  are positioned correctly but they do not connect in the right order. Auto Connect will be enabled when you select the first point, from this it will connect all points according the closest neighbor. Depending on the geometry structure it may simplify reordering of point indexes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mirror Horizontally: </strong>This mirrors the shape horizontally and is useful when correcting the shape of a duplicated side object or when it turns out that tracing the geometry of the start or end asset results in a flipped shape. </li>
                    <li><strong>Mirror Vertically: </strong>This mirrors the shape vertically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flip Faces: </strong>It may happen that the normals point in the wrong direction, you will notice this when rendering the side object. This button will flip the faces so it will appear correctly. This feature is also available in the <a href="#sideobjectinpector" class="link">Side Object Inspector</a>.<br>

                  </ol>
                  <p><strong>Update</strong> button. Click this button to automatically update the currently selected side object in the scene. This will only work if this side object is currently rendered for one of the EasyRoads3D objects in the scene.</p>

This is due to the vertice order in the mesh. You can correct this by changing the index of points. Start at one of the two points that should have only one connection. If the index is not 0 you can either set it to 0 by selecting 0 from the combobox at the top left. But preferably first check the other point that should only have one connection. If this point is set to index 0, start here. Now select the next point to which this point should connect. If it already connects, the index will be 1. If not, then select index 1 in the combobox for this point. Repeat this procedure until all points are correctly connected.                  </p>

This is the case when a single point is connected to 3 or more other points.If this happens, you simply click on the point and delete it untill it is only connected to 1 or 2 other points. If you want to be sure that indeed a point is covered by 2 vertices, you can select it and drag it. As it should only drag one point, the other point will now become visible at the same spot. If not, then this is a single point and you should not remove it. You can also clearly check if the number of points is correct by selecting one point and look at the top right in the combobox at the number of items. If this number is bigger then the visible number of points on the stage, you know there are duplicates!</p>

In the third image we have removed all duplicated points. It looks like a mess, but we can clearly see the shape we need by looking at the position of all the remaining points. In the last image on the right we have reindexed each point so they are now all connected in the right order.</p>

                  <p class="style1">This will happen when road vertices are below the terrains Y position because technically it is impossible to set terrain heights below its Y position. The road will be below the terrain in these areas. So make sure all markers are at least positioned at the terrains Y position. Also avoid big height differences between markers at the terrains Y position and the next marker. The road will first slightly move downwards to below the terrains Y position. To fix this situation, move the marker at the terrain Y position slightly upwards. </p>
                  <p class="style1">The road can also disappear below the terrain on terrains with a larger heightmap scale and considerable height differences in the road. There are simply not enough terrain points to accurately deform the terrain. You can see this when turning on Wireframe or Tex-Wire for scene view and zoom in to the critical area. You will clearly see the terrain points. To solve these situations, avoid big short height differences in the road or use an higher heightmap resolution on your terrain.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em>Side Objects do not appear</em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">This happens when you have chosen to disable this side object by default for each marker. To check this, select a marker, in the inspector select the specific side object from the Selected Object combobox and have a look at the Display Object property. Is it checked?</p>
<p><em><strong>Wrong Rotation Prefabs used in side objects</strong></em></p>
<p>Prefabs may appear in the scene with the wrong rotation. This is directly related to the mesh data of your prefab.</p>
<p>First, EasyRoads3D instantiates side objects according the direction of the spline path in the Z direction. So if you want to Instantiate a fence mesh along the track, the fence model must be modelled in the direction of the Z axis, not the X axis.</p>
<p>The second thing to check is how Unity displays the prefab and if that is the correct orientation. If it is the correct orientation, check the rotation values in the Inspector. Did Unity automatically apply rotation values to the prefab or are the rotation values (0, 0, 0)? If Unity did apply rotation values, these rotation values are ignored in EasyRoads3D.</p>
<p>You can  do two things to solve this. First you could change the rotation of the model in your  modeling app. Second, you can create an empty prefab, position it a (0, 0, 0),  add your real model as a child to this prefab at (0, 0, 0) and apply the same  rotation values as Unity does to this child object. Attach this new prefab to  the side object, the orientation should now be correct.</p>

<p class="style1">The materials and scripts available in the comboboxes are the currently available assets in the project referring to the water assets in the Standard and Pro Standard Assets folders. If you get error messages when swapping them it means the combination of the selected Material and selected script will not work. This usually happens when using either a Watr3 material or script on one of the older materials or scripts. This is taken care of in the scripts by automatically updating the material or script. However it may still raise an error. This is on the list to fix.</p>

                  <p class="style1">Do you get error messages in your project also unrelated to EasyRoads3D? Make sure Unity comples the project without red error messages. To ensure the problem is not related to EasyRoads3D you could test it in a new fresh empty project. Please contact us if creating a new object still fails.<br>
